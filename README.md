#Feed Reader Testing Project
This is a simple feed reader testing built for the purpose of Udacity Nanodegree Program.

## Getting Started
This is a simple feed reader testing with jasmine included. Our goal is to write a number of tests against a pre-existing application.These will test the underlying business logic of the application as well as the event handling and DOM manipulation.

## Instructions
* Open index.html.
* Open feedreader.js inside jasmins spec folder.
* Write tests against the pre existing application and check if they passed refreshing index.html .

## How I built the Feed Reader Testing
I worked on a static template given by Udacity.I used Jasmine documentation features.
* created 4 suites .
* created inside the suites various of test against the application.
* created test for testing asynchronous functions.
